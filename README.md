# MSFR_OpenMC

# Model and project description
This repository contains an OpenMC model of the EVOL reference MSFR as described in [2] and the code for simulating and plotting the main results for the DTU student project in [1]. The project aims to benchmark simulation results from [3] regarding the temperature dependency of the reactivity and the temperature coefficients of reactivity in the range of 300K-1800K. These temperature maps are needed to avoid the computational load of calculating the feedback directly for each step, e.g., for design optimization. 

The results confirm the roughly linear behavior of the total reactivity in the operating temperature range of the EVOL reference MSFR of 900K-1500K, where the total temperature coefficient was found to be approximately constant: alpha = -7.4+/-0.1 pcm/K in [1] (using OpenMC, ENDF-B.7.1), corresponding to a 2.4% difference from alpha = âˆ’7.58+/-0.05 pcm/K in [3] (using Serpent, Nuclear library not stated, but possibly ENDF-B.6 or JEFF-3.1 as deduced from [2] and [3]). The highest resolution achieved was #particles=300000 and #active_batches=110 due to limited computing power, and the difference fell with increasing resolution. Thus, higher resolution might further minimize the difference in alpha.

The reactivity and the temperature coefficient were split into contributions from Doppler broadening and density changes, which is necessary for design optimization since they display different feedback distributions over the core. The Doppler contribution was simulated by changing the material temperature in steps of 100K from 300K-1800K while holding the temperature to calculate the density constant at the benchmark temperature of 700C. Vice versa for the density temperature. Note that the Doppler contribution, therefore, includes all non-density-related temperature effects, such as the hardening of the neutron spectrum. A reference simulation was conducted, changing the temperatures together and showing similar results as the sum of the components. alpha = drho/dT was found through numerical differentiation.

# Description of Scripts
- "materials.py" and "geometry.py" are functions called by the run file "k_eff_loop.py" to build the materials and geometry of the recreated OpenMC model of the EVOL reference MSFR. "materials.py" takes a material temperature and a density temperature as inputs, exports the .xml file, and outputs the materials. "geometry.py" takes these materials as inputs, exports the .xml, and outputs the geometry.

- "geometry_plot.py" creates cross-sectional plots of the model geometry and saves them as "plot_xy.png," "plot_xz.png," and "plot_yz.png."

- "k_eff_loop.py" calls "geometry.py" and "materials.py" to build the model and runs OpenMC a total of 1+3x16=49 times:
  - 1 eigenvalue simulation at the benchmark temperature of 700C.
  - 16 with T going from 300K-1800K in steps of 100K.
  - 16 with density T going from 300K-1800K in steps of 100K, with material T = 700C giving density contribution to multiplication factor.
  - 16 with materials T going from 300K-1800K in steps of 100K, with density T = 700C giving Doppler contribution.

Data is saved in files "data/k_eff_XXXXX.txt" with columns:
{particles}, {batches}, {inactive_cycles}, {material_temp}, {density_temp}, {k_combined}
OBS: Update "filename" manually to avoid overwriting data.

- "shannon_entropy.py" plots the Shannon entropy calculated in "k_eff_loop.py". The entropy converges around batch 10, so 20 inactive batches were used.

- "parameter_plot.py" reads "k_eff_loop_XXXXX.txt" files, calculates reactivity and temperature coefficients of reactivity and its propagated uncertainty, and plots versus temperature in kelvin. An error-weighted curve fit is also plotted. It requires latex to be installed, or lines can be outcommented. Plots are saved in "k_eff_loop_XXXXX_rho_plot.png" and "k_eff_loop_XXXXX_coef_plot.png" if enabled.
